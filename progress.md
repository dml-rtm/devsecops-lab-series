## 🧠 Notes & Reflections

- **Lab 1:** Practiced core Git workflows with feature branches and tagging. Scaffolded multi-language structure early to reduce context switching.
- **Next Goal:** Finish Bash scripting for `backup.sh` with proper error handling and logging. Begin converting into Python CLI.
