# 🛠️ DevSecOps Lab Series

A progressive, hands-on lab series designed to develop and demonstrate skills in DevSecOps, Cloud Security, and Platform Engineering. Built using real-world tooling and workflows, each lab is version-controlled, documented, and implemented in multiple languages (Bash, Python, and Go) where applicable.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed to:
- Sharpen and demonstrate my skills in **CI/CD**, **Terraform**, **Kubernetes**, **Linux**, **Python**, **Go**, and **Git**
- Reflect the mindset and discipline of a **Platform Engineer**
- Serve as an evolving **technical portfolio** and learning sandbox

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

- 🚦 Git-first: Every lab is its own branch, PR, and versioned release
- 🧱 Multi-language: Solve each problem in Bash → Python → Go
- �� Security-aware: IAM, secrets, permissions baked into every layer
- 🧪 Realistic: Simulate production infrastructure and automation logic
